# Teachers-catalog
**Project has been created for the development of my skills in Python and DataBases.**

This bot for searching teachers and tutors in the Czech Republic. Also, if you are a teacher, you can add yourself to the database and edit your data. The bot is multilingual and supports Russian, English, Czech, Ukrainian languages.
