"""The embedder, and the rules that do not need it.

Everything here runs on fakes, and `conftest` points `MODEL_DIR` at nothing for
the whole suite, so the answers do not depend on whether this machine happens to
have 200 MB of model on it. The real one is exercised where it belongs: the
image build checks the files it baked in, and the fixture in the pull request
was measured through `parse` with it.

Three fakes, each for a different question. `FakeEmbedder` gives every text a
deterministic vector — enough for the rebuild. `PointedEmbedder` puts one query
on top of one passage, which tests the wiring. `RiggedEmbedder` sets the cosine
itself, which is the only way to ask what happens at 0.3.
