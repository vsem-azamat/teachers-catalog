"""The rule that turns a reference row into a name.

Five modules read names off the taxonomy, and four of them used to reach across
the package boundary into `catalog` for a private helper to do it. Now that the
rule has a home it gets a test of its own — the fallbacks in it are the
difference between a Ukrainian speaker seeing the Czech name of their faculty
and seeing a blank row, and nothing above this level would notice which.
