"""Every kind of help belongs to a group, and production hears about it.

Two different silent failures live here.

The first is a service type with no group. Both screens that show these tiles —
the catalog's front door and the screen where someone offers a service — render
by group, so an ungrouped type appears on neither. Nothing errors; the type is
simply invisible.

The second is the seed and the migration drifting apart. The deployment runs
`alembic upgrade head` and never runs `seed.py`, so a row that exists only in
the seed reaches every developer's database and no production one. The two
therefore hold the same reference data on purpose, and the last test here is
what keeps them saying the same thing.
