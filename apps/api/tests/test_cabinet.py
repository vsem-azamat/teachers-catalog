"""The helper's own profile: reading it back, and publishing without a subject.

Two changes are under test here. `GET /helper` is a new door onto a profile
that `/helpers/{id}` deliberately refuses to open — drafts and hidden ones —
because the person who wrote it has to be able to read it back. And publishing
no longer requires a recognised subject: the catalog needs people in it before
it needs them classified.
