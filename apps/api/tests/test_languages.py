"""The working-language list, cut from nine to four.

The list was wider than the interface, and the tail of it never matched a
single pair while making the question long enough to skip. Cutting it is easy;
the part worth a test is that nothing is deleted — `users.spoken_langs` and
`offers.langs` already hold these codes, and a row that vanished would take
somebody's profile data with it.
