"""The versioned API, assembled from one module per domain.

Every module here owns a slice of the URL space and nothing else: it parses the
request, leans on `konnekt.services` for the rules, and renders a schema from
`konnekt.api.schemas`. The prefix is declared once, here, so a module cannot
disagree with its neighbours about where it lives.

`health` is deliberately absent from this router — `/healthz` is not part of
the versioned API and must not move when the version does.
