"""Turning a reference row into the name a person reads.

Every reference table — service types, subjects, institutions, languages —
keeps its names in a side table with one row per language. Two questions come
up on nearly every screen: what does this row read as, and what do these twenty
ids read as. Both live here.

They live here because the alternative was `catalog._localised`, a private
symbol imported by name across the package boundary at sixteen call sites,
with three more hand-rolled "fetch the names for these ids" helpers alongside
it. A rule that four modules need is a rule, not a private helper of whichever
module happened to write it first.

Nothing here takes a `UiLang` on faith: a row with no translation in the asked
language falls back to any translation it has, because a missing Ukrainian name
should show the Czech one rather than an empty row.
