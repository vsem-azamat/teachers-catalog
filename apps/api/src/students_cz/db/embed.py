"""Fill `subject_embeddings` from the catalog and the model.

Derived data: this is the only thing that writes the table, and it can be run
at any time without asking what state it is in. The deploy runs it after
`alembic upgrade head`, which is also what makes changing the model an ordinary
deploy — the new one writes its own rows under its own name, and the old ones
stay where they are so a rollback still finds vectors to search.

Cheap on every run but the first: a row is keyed by the passage's hash and the
model, so a catalog that has not changed has nothing to embed.
