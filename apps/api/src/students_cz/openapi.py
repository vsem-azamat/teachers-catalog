"""Print the OpenAPI document to stdout.

The document is committed as `apps/api/openapi.json`, the contract the Mini App
(supervisor-telegram) generates its client from, so something has to produce
it without a server: CI has no reason to start one to read a description of
itself.

Importing the app is enough — the routes and schemas are declared at import
time, and the lifespan that needs a database never runs.
