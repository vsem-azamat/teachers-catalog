This is the piece that lets the interface have one input field instead of a
tree of categories. "нужен человек помочь с матаном на ČVUT, экзамен 14 февраля"

Deliberately rule-based for now. The rules are cheap, they run in milliseconds,
they never invent a subject that does not exist, and every failure is visible in
`search_queries`. A model can replace `parse()` later without anything upstream
