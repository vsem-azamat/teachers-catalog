"""Turning what a student typed into rows in the reference tables.

Students type slang, no diacritics, the wrong language and typos — often all
four at once: "нужен матан на чвуте", "prijimacky cvut", "mat analiza".

Two mechanisms, in order of confidence:

1. **Synonyms.** A curated list per subject, matched from the start of a word.
   A synonym of four characters or more may run into the middle of the word, so
   "матан" still finds "матаном" and "линал" finds "линала" — Russian and Czech
   inflect, and students type inflected forms. Shorter synonyms must be whole
   words, or "ос" would fire on "основы".

   What no synonym may do is start mid-word. Not
   as substrings: the synonym "TIN" sits inside "čeština", which once made
   "cestina b2 pro nostrifikaci" resolve to automata theory with full
   confidence. Both sides are reduced to space-delimited tokens and compared
   with the spaces included, so a synonym has to be whole words. A hit here is
   certain, so it scores 1.0.
2. **Trigram similarity** against every translated name, in all four languages
   at once — the person's interface language says nothing about which language
   they typed in.

`word_similarity` rather than `similarity`: the query is a sentence and the
name is two words, so plain similarity would score near zero. Word similarity
asks how well the name matches *some part* of the query, which is the actual
question.
