"""Response and request shapes for the mini app.

Two conventions worth stating once:

* **Data** is localised here; **chrome** is not. Names of subjects, faculties
  and service types arrive already in the caller's language, because those
  translations live in the database. Sentences the interface composes do not:
  they arrive as a `Phrase` — a code plus parameters — and the client renders
  them. Czech has four plural forms and Russian's are differently shaped; that
  belongs in the presentation layer, which has the rules, not in an API that
  would have to reimplement them.
* Screens are assembled server-side. `/home` returns the whole home screen in
  one response rather than making a phone on mobile data issue six requests.
