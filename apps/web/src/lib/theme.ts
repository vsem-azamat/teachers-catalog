/**
 * Which palette the page wears, and who decides.
 *
 * Three choices, not two. "System" is the honest default — most people never
 * touch this — but it cannot be the only option: a Mini App is opened from
 * inside a client that has a theme of its own, and someone reading in a dark
 * Telegram at midday is entitled to a light catalog. The resolved answer is
 * written to `data-theme` on the root element, which is the only thing
 * `styles/tokens.css` looks at.
 *
 * A module, not a hook. The choice outlives any one screen: the switch is on
 * the profile page, and it has to keep holding while the person is anywhere
 * else. Two things follow — the operating system is watched from here rather
 * than from a component, and the choice is remembered in memory as well as in
 * storage, so a browser that refuses to store it still honours it for the rest
 * of the session instead of snapping back the next time the profile mounts.
 *
 * The same key and the same resolution are duplicated, deliberately, by the
 * inline script in index.html — that copy runs before the first paint, so the
 * page never flashes the wrong palette. Keep the two in step.
