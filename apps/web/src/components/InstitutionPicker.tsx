/**
 * Which school, for the one kind of help that is about a particular one.
 *
 * `entrance_prep` is the only service type with `requires_institution`, and
 * until now nothing asked: the flag was read by no screen, so preparation for
 * ČVUT's entrance exam was stored the same way as preparation for nobody's.
 *
 * Filtered here rather than on the server, unlike subjects. The whole list is
 * sixteen universities and their 119 faculties — reference data that changes
 * about never — so it is one request, cached for an hour, and every keystroke
 * after it is free. Subjects go to the server because there are hundreds of
 * them and the match has to be fuzzy across four languages; a school is matched
 * on its own name and its abbreviation, which a substring test does.
 *
 * `taken` is not politeness: `offers` is unique on its four axes, so a second
 * row for the same school is a 422 the screen can only report as "did not
 * save".
