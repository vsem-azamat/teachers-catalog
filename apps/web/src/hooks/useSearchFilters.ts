/**
 * The filters a query string describes, as the search endpoint takes them.
 *
 * Shared by the two screens that read the same query string: the search screen,
 * which shows how many people it finds and the first two of them, and the
 * results screen, which lists them. Those two numbers have to be the same
 * number — that is the whole point of showing one at all — and a second copy of
 * this mapping is the way they would stop being.
 *
 * The clarifying answer travels as a service *code* rather than an id, because
 * the screen that asks the question has no reason to hold the reference list.
 * Resolving it needs that list, so `filters` is null until it is here: filtering
 * by nothing instead would count everyone who teaches the subject and then hand
 * over to a screen that does apply the filter.
