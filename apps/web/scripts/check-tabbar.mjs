/*
 * The tab bar must not show what is passing under it.
 *
 * The contract is in docs/architecture.md: anything pinned to an edge is
 * fixed, and a fixed bar is opaque behind its own controls. The bug this
 * guards against is not a layout one — nothing overflows, nothing overlaps
 * wrongly, and every element is exactly where it was put. It is that the bar's
 * background reached full opacity over only part of its height while its
 * contents were centred over all of it, so the top of every icon was painted
 * onto whatever card happened to be sliding underneath.
 *
 * Which is why this is measured photographically rather than geometrically.
 * There is no number in the DOM for "how much of this gradient is see-through
 * where the icons are": the paint is the answer, so the paint is what gets
 * compared. Take the bar's picture with the list at the top, move the list
 * under it, take it again. A bar that is opaque behind its controls cannot be
 * changed by what passes beneath it; one that is not changes in exactly the
 * places where it is see-through.
 *
 * A fade above the bar is not what this forbids and not what it sees: the
 * crop is the bar's own border box, and a `::before` placed above it falls
 * outside that box.
 *
 * Needs the same running stack as check-scroll.mjs — see scripts/lib/stack.mjs
 * for what it checks before measuring anything. Where `make web` cannot have
 * sudo for mkcert, run it with VITE_NO_HTTPS=1 and pass
 * BASE=http://localhost:5173.
