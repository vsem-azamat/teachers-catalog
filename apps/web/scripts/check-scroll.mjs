/*
 * Nothing should be scrollable to a stretch of nothing.
 *
 * The contract is in docs/architecture.md: the Mini App is a screen, not a
 * document. The bug this guards against is not "the page scrolls" — a list is
 * supposed to — it is travel that reveals nothing, which reads as a broken
 * screen and is invisible on a desktop window.
 *
 * "A screen that fits must not scroll" was the obvious rule and it is the
 * wrong one. For any layout there is a band of viewport heights where the
 * content is a handful of pixels too tall, so a threshold on travel only moves
 * the failing size around; it says nothing about whether the travel was
 * pointless. What separates the bug from an ordinary short list is what is
 * waiting at the end of the scroll.
 *
 * So the measurement is geometric and needs no scrolling at all: how far is
 * the lowest thing that paints from the bottom of the screen's content box?
 * The screen's own `padding-bottom` is by design and is subtracted, which is
 * also what keeps the number honest on a phone with a home indicator, where
 * that padding includes the inset. Anything left over is dead space.
 *
 * A container does not paint on behalf of its children: a spacer nested inside
 * a card list is the same bug as one at the foot of the screen, and an earlier
 * version of this check — which took any element with children as content —
 * could see the second and not the first.
 *
 * Measured at several viewport sizes, because a screen that fits on a tall
 * phone is not the question.
 *
 * What it cannot do: the mock in `src/mockEnv.ts` reports `tdesktop`, where the
 * SDK synthesises the viewport from `window.innerHeight`, so `--app-height`
 * here is always the same number as the `100dvh` fallback. The iOS and Android
 * path that variable exists for is not exercised by anything on this machine.
 *
 * Needs the dev server (`make web`) and the API behind it, with a signed
 * `VITE_MOCK_INIT_DATA` in `apps/web/.env.local` — the API answers 401 to the
 * unsigned mock, and a screen full of error states is not the screen being
 * measured. All three are checked before anything is measured.
 *
 * `make web` serves https through mkcert, which needs sudo once. Where it
 * cannot have it, run the server with VITE_NO_HTTPS=1 and pass
 * BASE=http://localhost:5173.

 * The detail screens are behind an id this script cannot know, so they are

 *
 * One screen cannot be reached that way at all. `/offer/prices` opens on
 * Telegram's main button, which no browser has, and it redirects to `/offer`
 * without a choice in router state — so it is entered by pushing that state,
 * the same shape the app pushes. Until it was, the screen was not measured at
 * any size; being measured is the whole of what this buys. What it catches is
 * what it catches everywhere else: emptiness under the last thing on the
 * screen. A gap left between two cards is above the segmented control at the
 * foot, and no version of this check has ever seen one.
 *
 * `expect` is what stops a rename of either service code from quietly
 * measuring the grid a second time under this screen's name.
